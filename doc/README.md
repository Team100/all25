Documentation for Team100 control engineering software.

## Getting Started

First time working on Control? Fret not! This guide will walk you through everything from setting up your development environment, to deploying code to the RoboRIO, to controlling your first motor, and then to building a complex robot. It's an in-progress guide so please add to it anytime you see gaps.

Chapters:
1. [Setting up your development environment](README_1_STARTING.md)
2. [Getting your first motor running](README_2_MOTOR.md)
3. [Creating a new 'study'](README_3_STUDY.md)
