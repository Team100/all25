/**
 * This is a minimum-time controller for the double integrator, with
 * acceleration and velocity limits. The control policy is to apply maximum
 * acceleration towards the goal (tracing the "initial path" in state space, a
 * parabola), until the "switching curve" is reached, and then apply maximum
 * deceleration before arriving (following the switching curve to the goal, on
 * the "goal path"). This strategy is a type of "sliding mode" controller, and
 * so it is subject to "chatter" on the switching curve.
 * 
 * To prevent chattering, the switching curve acceleration is slightly higher
 * than the actual goal path acceleration, which leads the system to drift away
 * from the switching curve. The "initial path" acceleration is a little higher
 * than the switching curve acceleration, which pushes the system back on to the
 * switching curve. So the control output does chatter a bit between "really all
 * the way on" and "most of the way on" -- much better than full scale reverse
 * chatter. The level of chattering (and thus the level of disturbance-rejecting
 * control authority available) is adjustable. Note that these differences in
 * effort will make the ETA wrong, which is fine, we don't use the ETA anywhere.
 * Note if we want to coordinate multiple axes using ETA's, we'll have to change
 * this.
 * 
 * Control switches to full-state proportional feedback in the neighborhood of
 * the goal, to prevent full-scale orbiting.
 * 
 * The usual WPI pattern for this sort of path would be to construct a feasible
 * trapezoid profile, and then use a combination of feedforward and feedback
 * control to follow it. The issue with that approach is that the profile
 * blindly follows its own timer, which results in two problems: ignorance of
 * disturbances and tuning complexity: feedback parameters need to work well
 * with a very strong feedforward input *and* with the total absence of
 * feedforward (in case the profile timer expires).
 * 
 * {@see https://liberzon.csl.illinois.edu/teaching/cvoc/node85.html}
 * {@see https://underactuated.mit.edu/dp.html#minimum_time_double_integrator}
 * 
 * This class is very similar to
 * {@link org.team100.lib.profile.TrapezoidProfile100}, described here:
 * 
 * This uses the approach from LaValle 2023: between any two points in phase
 * space, the optimal acceleration-limited path is via two parabolas, perhaps
 * with a velocity limit.
 * 
 * The notation here is from that paper. Every point in phase space is
 * intersected with two minimum-time parabolas: one corresponding to maximum
 * acceleration, the other to maximum deceleration. The paper was concerned with
 * coordinating multiple axes, so there's a lot in it about non-minimum-time
 * paths. For our purpose here, the simple minimum-time case is all that
 * matters.
 * 
 * The simplest case links a state with zero velocity to another state with
 * position to the right, and also with zero velocity: the result is a
 * symmetrical pair of parabolas, an initial one for acceleration ("I" for
 * "initial") and the second for deceleration to the goal ("G" for "goal"). The
 * intersection is called the "switching point." A path with initial
 * acceleration followed by deceleration to the goal is called "I+G-". The other
 * pairing is also possible, for example the goal could be to the left of the
 * initial state, so the initial acceleration to get there would be negative.
 * 
 * The same picture applies to nonzero-velocity cases, and to cases with
 * velocities of opposite sign: any two states can be linked by either an I+G-
 * or I-G+ path.
 * 
 * Adding a velocity limit means that the "switching point" may be clipped off,
 * so the path is something like I+CG-, "C" for "cruise."
 * 
 * So there are three kinds of boundaries: I-G, I-cruise, and cruise-G.
 * 
 * https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01744.pdf
 * 
 * This class is different from the WPI profile class -- it keeps no state, it
 * just takes one dt step at a time. It doesn't have the notion of a profile
 * being "completed" -- if you want that, compare the output to the goal. The
 * main benefit of the approach here is that it correctly handles cases
 * involving moving end states that the WPI code does not handle correctly.
 * 
 * It might be slower around the switching points, since it can call itself once
 * or twice, once per segment.
