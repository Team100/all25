/**
 * For kinematics, the module delta is the dx and dy of each corner, i.e. it's a
 * distance and an angle.
 * 
 * In the real world, consecutive module positions will have different angles,
 * and this class needs to make some assumption about what happened in between.
 * The WPI code assumes that the second angle covers the whole period in
 * between. For awhile, we assumed the angle was smoothly varying between start
 * and end, and computed something like the chord line, but I think that
 * produced inconsistent results.
 * 
 * Actuation uses module "state" i.e. velocity, which is applied to the modules,
 * which are assumed to respond instantly.
 * 
 * At higher levels we constrain steering rate to be achievable, but the
 * maximum rate is quite high, over 10 rad/s, so the change in one 0.02s dt is
 * tenths of radians, not negligible.
 * 
 * But the inverse kinematics produces constant-steering deltas, and so should
 * we here, so we use the ending angle for the whole path.
