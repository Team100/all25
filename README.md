all25 contains *all* the Team 100 code for *2025.*  There's just one repository,
so that sharing library code across projects is easier.

This style of code management is sometimes called a ["monorepo"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) if you want to read more about it.

What's here:

* **comp**: RoboRIO competition code for 2025
* **doc**: Documentation: look here for instructions!
* **lib**: Evergreen RoboRIO library code
* **raspberry_pi** coprocessor tasks: vision, logging, GTSAM
* **studies**: small independent projects
  * your project
  * another project
  * etc ...
