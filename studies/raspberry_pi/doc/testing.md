# Testing

The vscode "Testing" gadget works with the unittests as set up here.
Click on the little Erlenmeyer flask on the left side to use it.

What doesn't work is the little "run" triangles in the upper-right corner
of the editor.  I think i tries to run the python file as a "script"
rather than a "module," and there's no easy way to change that behavior.
