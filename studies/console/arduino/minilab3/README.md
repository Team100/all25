# MiniLab 3

This is a version of the MIDI controller bridge suitable for the Arturia MiniLab 3 controller,
which has 25 keys, four sliders, eight knobs, eight buttons, and a few other surfaces.

This uses an 
[Adafruit Feather 32u4](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2771),
an [Adafruit MIDI FeatherWing](https://learn.adafruit.com/products/4740/guides),
and the [FortySevenEffects Arduino MIDI library](https://github.com/FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library)
to make a MIDI controller appear like a USB HID with 32 buttons.

The button mapping is TBD.
